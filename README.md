# Slot Machine 

## Project Description 
This Python program acts as a 3-reel slot machine. Each reel has symbols which are the letters A-H which differ in frequency per reel. 

When the program is started it prompts the user to enter an input for an amount to be deposited. The program will ask for another input for how many lines the user would like to bet on and how much money they would like to bet on those lines. The lines are then generated and the winnings, the winning lines and the current balance are displayed.

Python 3.8.5 was used so as to learn its basic syntax and semantics through the operations of a slot machine. 

A challenge that came about was how to create three different dictionaries for each reel so that the frequency of the symbols could be different with each reel. This dictionary feature will be helpful for future uses where a key and value is paired together.
