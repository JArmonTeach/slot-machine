# Slot Machine 

## Project Description 
This Python program acts as a 3-reel slot machine. Each reel has symbols which are the letters A-H which differ in frequency per reel. 

Python 3.8.5 was used so as to learn its basic syntax and semantics through the operations of a slot machine. 

A challenge that came about was how to create three different dictionaries for each reel so that the frequency of the symbols could be different with each reel. This dictionary feature will be helpful for future uses where a key and value is paired together.
